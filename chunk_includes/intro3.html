<b>Instructions</b>
</p>


<p>
After you have finished reading, you will see a question about the sentence <b>you just read</b>. Every question has two possible answers, Yes on the left, and No on the right. You can indicate your response by pressing "<b>1</b>" if you think "Yes" is the correct answer, and "<b>2</b>" if you think "No" is the correct answer. Sometimes you may not be sure which answer is correct. When this happens, go with your first instinct, don't over think it! 
</p>
<p>
Throughout the experiment, you should always keep your hands positioned so that your thumbs are on the spacebar, and your fingers are on the "1" and "2" keys. Remember, please try to press the spacebar fast enough to allow for relatively natural reading of the sentence.
</p>

To ensure that you can see all of the sentences you will read, please maximize your browser screen now, and close any other open windows.
